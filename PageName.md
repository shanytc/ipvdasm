#iPVDasm, the first native 32bit Disassembler for the iPhone.

# Introduction #

iPVDasm v0.1, is a linux port of the PVDasm's core engine.
There is no UI yet, and the file can be executed via a terminal application.
Currently it is disassembling a raw vector (not yet a binary file) and outputting the result on the main shell.
